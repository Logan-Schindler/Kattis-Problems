# Kattis-Problems
This repository will hold all of my solutions to problems that are on the website Kattis.
Kattis is a website that used for testing the correctness and speed of programs, all Kattis problems
are tested by taking in an input from the console and outputing some answer to the console.
I personally am using C++ to solve these problems.
